Traffic Signal E-Challan System


Developed a smart traffic monitoring system to automatically capture vehicle registration numbers of traffic signal violators for e-challan generation.

Leveraged ESP32-CAM for real-time image capture and an Ultrasonic Sensor to detect vehicles crossing the stop line during red or yellow signals.

Programmed using Arduino IDE with violation data displayed via Serial Monitor for analysis and penalty processing.

Used FTDI Programmer to upload and configure code on the ESP32-CAM module.


Key Features / Highlights:

Automated violation detection based on traffic signal states and vehicle movement.

Captures and stores images of violating vehicles for enforcement records.

Cost-effective IoT solution adaptable for real-world traffic intersections.

Real-time monitoring through Serial Output Display.
